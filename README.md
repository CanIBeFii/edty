# EDTY

This is a small project built in Rust that aims to help me familiarize myself with the language. It's a simple terminal based text editor inspired by [hecto](https://github.com/pflenker/hecto-tutorial).

I've followed the [tutorial](https://www.flenker.blog/hecto/) and now I'm trying to add some features to it.
